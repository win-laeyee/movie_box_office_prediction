Twenty-five million albums sold in his thirty year-long career, unfading success and a unique story: Vasco Rossi talks about himself in this documentary and for the first time presents us with an intimate self portrait. A new, authentic picture is created of this rockstar from Emilia Romagna thanks to super 8 footage, family photographs and amateur videos.

{"adult": false, "also_known_as": ["Precious Lucy", "Lusfisto", "Lucy Fer", "Lucifer", "LuFisto"], "biography": "is a female Canadian professional wrestler better known by her ring name LuFisto.  Career 1997\u20131998 LuFisto began training when she was 17 years old in her hometown of Sorel-Tracy, Quebec. On June 23, 1997, she made her debut in St-Leonard-d'Aston, Quebec, under the ring name Lucifer. She then moved to Montreal where she joined RWR and Northern Championship Wrestling (NCW). Her first trip to the States was in 1998, wrestling for Eastern Township Wrestling Alliance, where she modified her name to Lucy Fer.  1998\u20131999 In late 1998, she joined the Eastern Wrestling Alliance under the name Luscious Lucy as \"Centerfold\" Steve Ramsey's valet. She also began appearing at Green Mountain Wrestling shows in Vermont at this point. By mid-1999, working for International Wrestling 2000 in Quebec, The Mountie Jacques Rougeau changed her name to Precious Lucy. At EWA, she was teaming with Mark \"Jaguar\" Nugera and manager Joshua Shea to form Partners in Crime in many mixed gender tag-team and singles bouts. Precious Lucy also became the first female in Quebec to win a male championship at ICW, defeating Serge Proulx for the ICW Provincial Championship. This is also where she developed her hardcore style.  2000\u20132005 In 2002, under the ring name LuFisto, she was booked to appear in the main event of Blood, Sweat N' Ears in a match featuring hardcore wrestler Bloody Bill Skullion. The Ontario Athletics Commission, citing a regulation that prevented women and men from wrestling each other, threatened to withdraw the license for the show. This essentially banned LuFisto from wrestling in Ontario. She lodged a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission. On February 26, 2006, the OHRC informed LuFisto that they had convinced the OAC to drop the regulation. The OAC subsequently dropped the vast majority of the regulations affecting professional wrestling in Ontario, a move which removed a great deal of the bureaucracy stifling independent wrestling in the province. LuFisto then worked primarily for National Wrestling Alliance's NWA Quebec Pro Wrestling promotion, where she is head trainer (along with Dru Onyx) of their wrestling school, Onyx and LuFisto's Torture Chamber.", "birthday": "1980-02-15", "deathday": null, "gender": 1, "homepage": null, "id": 2264493, "imdb_id": null, "known_for_department": "Acting", "name": "Genevieve Goulet", "place_of_birth": "Sorel, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada", "popularity": 6.502, "profile_path": "/ysGbqyDTr1xf9ca9S6LWnrH6miO.jpg", "movie_credits": {"cast": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/wGh3UsjKP6QljHOa08a33OiI2w2.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 18], "id": 587897, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "BCW Queen Of The North", "overview": "After months of waiting, it's finally time for Brii Combination Wrestling's Queen of the North where we will crown the first ever BCW Women's Champion.

After the commercial failure of their only album, The Fourth World (released in 1997), the band split up. In 2001, the group was reformed \u2013 with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up \u2013 and began a new, musical chapter, changing their name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released four more albums, It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012) and V (2014). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and a World Music Award.\n\nSince 2011, Levine has served as a coach on NBC's reality talent show The Voice. The winners of the first and fifth seasons, Javier Colon and Tessanne Chin, were on his team. In 2012, he made his acting debut as a recurring character in the horror television show American Horror Story: Asylum for the series' second season. He also appeared in the film Begin Again.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, Levine launched his own eponymous fragrance line in 2013. The same year, he collaborated with Kmart and ShopYourWay.com to develop his menswear collection. He also owns a record label, 222 Records. In 2013, The Hollywood Reporter reported that \"sources familiar with his many business dealings\" estimated Levine would earn more than $35 million that year.\u00a0", "birthday": "1979-03-18", "deathday": null, "gender": 2, "homepage": "http://www.maroon5.com/", "id": 217371, "imdb_id": "nm1747013", "known_for_department": "Acting", "name": "Adam Levine", "place_of_birth": "Los Angeles, California, USA", "popularity": 12.841, "profile_path": "/ucSpYIUJ0gKkHlPhQrHEs2HdFxZ.jpg", "movie_credits": {"cast": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 140614, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Maroon 5 Overexposed Live in S\u00e3o Paulo", "overview": "On 26 August 2012, during their Overexposed Tour in South America, Maroon 5 performed in front of 30.000 people at Arena Anhembi, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, which according to Levine has become their biggest paying public to an exclusive concert of the band to date.", "popularity": 0.969, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "2012-08-26", "title": "Maroon 5 Overexposed Live in S\u00e3o Paulo", "video": false, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "character": "Lead singer and rhythm guitar", "credit_id": "52fe4a959251416c750e7197", "order": 0}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [10402], "id": 375166, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sinatra 100: An All-Star Grammy Concert", "overview": "A tribute concert celebrating Frank Sinatra\u2019s 100th birthday that promises performances from Tony Bennett, Garth Brooks, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Adam Levine, Carrie Underwood, Usher, Zac Brown, Harry Connick Jr., Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Juanes.", "popularity": 3.087, "poster_path": "/6HlRPfKGfvZp4kMiz9UX2IQCse0.jpg", "release_date": "2015-12-06", "title": "Sinatra 100: An All-Star Grammy Concert", "video": true, "vote_average": 9.3, "vote_count": 3, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "56851d88c3a3683628003193", "order": 11}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5Hyp6Gt7GrmoIQgwXPtGszS2OHh.jpg", "genre_ids": [10402], "id": 132574, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Maroon 5 - Rock in Rio", "overview": "A great show by Maroon 5 at Palco Mundo stage on Saturday 1st October 2011 in Rock In Rio 2011.

{"adult": false, "also_known_as": [], "biography": "Peter McNamara, born in London and attended the National Youth Theatre and trained at LAMDA. Possibly best known as Ralph Passmore, the nemesis of Tucker Jenkin's in Tucker's Luck (1983), the spin off series of Phil Redmond's Grange Hill (1978). Peter was known for his fantastic singing voice in many theatre musical productions including South Pacific. He started out his long list of jobs as a supporting artist, working on such films as Quadrophenia (1979), The Shining (1980), Chariots of Fire (1981) and Star Wars (1977), before being cast in Grange Hill (1978). He worked frequently with Christopher Menaul who cast him as a Chelsea skinhead Rory in The Treatment (1984) and previously Tucker's Luck (1983). He became a well respected character actor in a career that eventually spanned four decades, he was often called upon to play the menacing hard-man and when Denzel Washington came to London to work on For Queen & Country (1988), Peter was asked to show him around and guide him on the Cockney accent. In 1990, Peter starred as Kenno in the controversial football hooligan film, Arrivederci Millwall (1990), one of the first films to tackle that subject. He went onto play Jimmy Cadogan in the children's TV series; Oasis (1993) in 1993 and a spot on 99-1 (1994) which reunited him with Arrivederci Millwall (1990) director Charles McDougall. Despite his hard-man roles Peter often played in a lot of comedy TV shows including Desmond's (1989) and Harry Enfield and Chums (1994). In 1995, he appeared in Funny Bones (1995) with Lee Evans, Jerry Lewis, Oliver Platt and Oliver Reed. Then in 1996 he was seen in the series No Bananas (1996) as DS Howard. He was in both the film and TV series of London's Burning (1988) and played recurring roles in numerous other British TV shows including Thief Takers (1995), The Bill (1984), Trial & Retribution (1997), Silent Witness (1996) and Casualty (1986). In 2002, he appeared as Frederick Michael Argyle in The Gathering (2002) where he acted alongside Christina Ricci, Ioan Gruffudd and Stephen Dillane. In 2004, he appeared in an extraordinary experimental drama documentary called Pissed on the Job (2004), Peter played a heavy drinker who was also a teacher, the film which can be seen online is a great example of his work, his subtle performance is extremely realistic in this damning piece about the dangers of alcohol. He showed up as a vampire drug dealer in the film Dead Cert (2010) in 2010 and had been working on some low budget films in the latter years of his career that sadly never got released due to budget and various technical issues. His last credit Dinklebrain (2012) was not the last film he made, rumour has it that he was very much actively making some independent short films, which hopefully will emerge in the near future.

These jumps were repeated, not as a publicity exercise or as a movie stunt, but as part of the development of a recurring recreational activity. This approach defined modern BASE jumping. These were the jumps that popularized BASE jumping more widely among parachutists, likely because Boenish filmed them and presented the footage exceptionally well. Boenish also published BASE Magazine to promote safety in this new sport.\n\nBoenish's cinematography work included the 1969 John Frankenheimer parachuting film classic The Gypsy Moths, starring Burt Lancaster and Gene Hackman, and a National Geographic Explorer segment on jumps from El Capitan.\n\nHis life and death is the subject of the 2015 documentary film, Sunshine Superman.", "birthday": "1941-04-03", "deathday": "1984-07-07", "gender": 2, "homepage": null, "id": 2112308, "imdb_id": null, "known_for_department": "Acting", "name": "Carl Boenisch", "place_of_birth": "New Castle, Pennsylvania", "popularity": 0.6, "profile_path": null, "movie_credits": {"cast": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/vGO6RbAPmArIY6FyAOGS8sPJQJ8.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 292081, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sunshine Superman", "overview": "Documentary portrait of Carl Boenish, the father of the BASE jumping movement, whose early passion for skydiving led him to ever more spectacular -and dangerous- feats of foot-launched human flight.", "popularity": 4.508, "poster_path": "/hCfe6xbM3dcV5AYTL5KQn8AUKRD.jpg", "release_date": "2015-05-22", "title": "Sunshine Superman", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 28, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "5b7c5633c3a368767b000a49", "order": 0}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 1235002, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Sky Divers", "overview": "A behind-the-scenes, promotional short about the making of the feature film The Gypsy Moths (1969), which extensively features free fall skydiving.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1969-01-01", "title": "The Sky Divers", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "65af5785f8aee800eaa81dc1", "order": 1}], "crew": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/mFF0OIM0FTlT58teE2bUX7IoTBx.jpg", "genre_ids": [10749, 18, 28], "id": 64079, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Gypsy Moths", "overview": "Three skydivers and their travelling thrill show barnstorm through a small midwestern town one Fourth of July weekend.", "popularity": 8.175, "poster_path": "/ojSarHMxAFII9qAEC4tnN7PfLNT.jpg", "release_date": "1969-08-29", "title": "The Gypsy Moths", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 39, "credit_id": "5e41af790c271000157fea7d", "department": "Camera", "job": "Aerial Camera"}]}}

She performed violin and ballet as a young girl.\n\nShe attended a private high school and later moved to the United States where she earned a bachelor's degree, with honors, in biological sciences from the University of California, Irvine. At UCI, she won the Chang Pin-Chun Undergraduate Research Award for molecular research involving cancer treatment and heart transplant rejection. She was also Assistant Editor-in-Chief of MedTimes, UCI's undergraduate medical newspaper.\n\nNazanin Boniadi is rapidly making her mark in both film and television. She co-starred as CIA analyst Fara Sherazi on seasons three and four of the Emmy and Golden Globe award-winning drama Homeland (2011), for which she shared a 2015 SAG Award nomination in the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series category. Boniadi appeared in the 2016 MGM-Paramount remake of Ben-Hur. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov, the film stars Ms. Boniadi in the female lead role of Esther opposite Jack Huston, Morgan Freeman and Toby Kebbell. She will next appear in a leading role opposite Armie Hammer and Dev Patel in Anthony Maras's Hotel Mumbai.\n\nAmong her many television credits, Boniadi portrayed Nora, a relatively longstanding love interest to Neil Patrick Harris's Barney Stinson, in seasons six and seven of How I Met Your Mother (2005). She also appeared as the notorious Adnan Salif in season three of Shonda Rhimes' hit political drama Scandal (2012). She will next star alongside J.K. Simmons in the original Starz series Counterpart (2017), created by Justin Marks and Executive Produced by Morten Tyldum.\n\nOn film, Boniadi appeared as Amira Ahmed in Jon Favreau's Iron Man (2008) and portrayed a young mother, Elaine, in Paul Haggis' The Next Three Days (2010). She also has several independent features to her credit.\n\nBorn in Tehran at the height of the Iranian Revolution, Boniadi's parents relocated to London, England, shortly thereafter, where she was raised with an emphasis on education. While she was involved in theatre early in life, Boniadi later decided she wanted to become a physician. She moved to the United States at the age of 19 to attend the University of California, Irvine, where she received her Bachelor's Degree, with Honors (Dean's Academic Achievement and Service Award) in Biological Sciences, and won the \"Chang Pin Chun\" Undergraduate Research Award for her work in heart-transplant rejection and cancer research.\n\nSwitching gears to pursue her first love, Boniadi then decided to study acting, which included training in Contemporary Drama at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London under the supervision of dramaturge Lloyd Trott.\n\nBoniadi is fluent in both English and Persian. She is a dedicated human rights activist.

{"adult": false, "also_known_as": ["King of Country"], "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nGeorge Harvey Strait (born May 18, 1952) is an American country music singer, actor and music producer. Strait is referred to as the \"King of Country,\" and critics call Strait a living legend. He is known for his unique style of western swing music, bar-room ballads, honky-tonk style, and fresh yet traditional Country music. George Strait holds the world record for more #1 hit singles than any other artist in the history of music on any chart or in any genre, having recorded 57 #1 hit singles as of 2010.\n\nStrait rocketed to success after his first single \"Unwound\" was a hit in 1981. While contributing to the neo-traditional movement of the 1980s, he amassed seven number one albums in the decade with his most popular hits including \"Fool Hearted Memory\" and \"Ocean Front Property\". By the 1990s, Strait had influenced a new breed of performers while continuing his own successes, having charted upwards of 20 number one hits including \"Heartland\" and \"Blue Clear Sky\". The next decade for which he was named Artist Of The Decade by the ACM, he was elected into the Country Music Hall of Fame and won his first Grammy award for his hit album Troubadour. Strait continued his previous successes during this time, producing a more contemporary sound with moderate cross-over hits including \"She'll Leave You with a Smile\" and \"You'll Be There\".\n\nStrait won CMA Entertainer of the year in 1989 and 1990 and ACM Entertainer of the year in 1990. He has been nominated for more CMA and ACM awards and has more wins in both categories than any other artist. As of 2009, he holds the record for the most Number One hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts with 44 number one singles on that chart. Counting all other music charts, Strait has amassed a total of 57 number one hits overall, breaking a record previously set by Conway Twitty.\n\nStrait has sold more than 68.5 million albums in the United States and his certifications from the RIAA include 13 multi-platinum, 33 platinum and 38 gold albums. His best-selling album is Pure Country (1992), which sold 6 million (6\u00d7 Multi-platinum). His highest certified album is Strait Out of the Box (1995), which sold 2 million copies (8\u00d7 Multi-Platinum due to being a box set with four CDs). According to the RIAA, Strait is the 12th best-selling recording artist with the albums in the United States overall.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Juan de George Strait, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.", "birthday": "1952-05-18", "deathday": null, "gender": 2, "homepage": null, "id": 93841, "imdb_id": "nm0833180", "known_for_department": "Acting", "name": "George Strait", "place_of_birth": "Poteet, Texas, USA", "popularity": 4.181, "profile_path": "/227ebFqItSeUi8xn0ZFLVULqGJJ.jpg", "movie_credits": {"cast": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/x5SGeaiCylpjKxnMgWAgkQcVubb.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10402, 10749], "id": 22627, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Pure Country", "overview": "Dusty Chandler is a super star in the country music world, but his shows have the style of a '70s rock concert.

Documentarian Frederick Wiseman has been noted for his ability to capture the nuances of life in American institutions such as prisons, hospitals, welfare offices, and high schools. He started out in 1963 by producing a fictional feature film, The Cool World, an examination of the lives of Harlem teenagers. In the beginning, Wiseman was a staunch social reformist, and his films were calls for change. Titicut Follies, his first documentary, is an expos\u00e9 of life in a prison for the criminally insane in Bridgewater, MA. It was controversial and left Wiseman with the reputation of being a muckraker. His four subsequent documentaries were all expos\u00e9s of other tax-supported institutions designed to show the ineffectiveness of the bureaucracy that not only threatens to destroy them, but also dehumanizes the people they were meant to serve. Wiseman toned down his message and began focusing more on American culture to point out the symbolism of daily activities in his film Primate (1974). In the \u201880s, he began examining institutions as they relate to ideology. Unlike other documentaries, Wiseman\u2019s work does not progress chronologically; rather, the segments are arranged thematically, like an essay, and are linked via rhetorical devices such as comparison and contrast to create a patterned structure. His films are never narrated, thereby forcing viewers to make connections between the sequences themselves. Wiseman has occasionally returned to fictional films, albeit in a non-fiction performance style, as with Seraphita\u2019s Diary (1982) and La Derniere Lettre (2002).", "birthday": "1930-01-01", "deathday": null, "gender": 2, "homepage": "http://www.zipporah.com/", "id": 138006, "imdb_id": "nm0936464", "known_for_department": "Directing", "name": "Frederick Wiseman", "place_of_birth": "Boston, Massachusetts, USA", "popularity": 3.604, "profile_path": "/h0SIW7kP02MUFv8bqIhXZlibUvM.jpg", "movie_credits": {"cast": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 342240, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Aujourd'hui", "overview": "A short film by Nicolas Saada.", "popularity": 1.608, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "2012-12-12", "title": "Aujourd'hui", "video": false, "vote_average": 1.5, "vote_count": 2, "character": "L'homme", "credit_id": "5567cd33c3a3686bc30001a7", "order": 1}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 342239, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Next to Last (Autumn 63)", "overview": "In a private collection in Arlington, French actor and director Mathieu Amalric, who won the Best director award in Cannes) takes his camera to one of Hopper's latest masterpiece, one of the most mysterious as well.

{"adult": false, "also_known_as": ["Jerome John \"Jerry\" Garcia"], "biography": "Jerome John \"Jerry\" Garcia (August 1, 1942 \u2013 August 9, 1995) was an American musician best known for his lead guitar work, singing and songwriting with the band the Grateful Dead. Though he vehemently disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or \"spokesman\" of the group.\n\nAs one of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for their entire three-decade career (1965\u20131995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders-Garcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), Jerry Garcia Band, Old and in the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson).\u00a0 He also released several solo albums, and contributed to a number of albums by other artists over the years as a session musician.\n\nHe was well known by many for his distinctive guitar playing and was ranked 13th in Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" cover story. Later in life, Garcia was sometimes ill because of his unstable weight, and in 1986 went into a diabetic coma that nearly cost him his life. Although his overall health improved somewhat after that, he also struggled with heroin addiction,\u00a0 and was staying in a California drug rehabilitation facility when he died of a heart\u00a0 attack in August 1995.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jerry Garcia, licensed under CC-BY-SA,full list of contributors on Wikipedia. \n\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0", "birthday": "1942-08-01", "deathday": "1995-08-09", "gender": 2, "homepage": "http://www.jerrygarcia.com/", "id": 1442, "imdb_id": "nm0305263", "known_for_department": "Acting", "name": "Jerry Garcia", "place_of_birth": "San Francisco, California, U.S.", "popularity": 5.313, "profile_path": "/6jAKLIekOs6FFcc783PZ1pb8soe.jpg", "movie_credits": {"cast": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/1UZn5MA63PjaVCf470o0fz5nrbv.jpg", "genre_ids": [99, 10402], "id": 132, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Gimme Shelter", "overview": "A detailed chronicle of the famous 1969 tour of the United States by the British rock band The Rolling Stones, which culminated with the disastrous and tragic concert held on December 6 at the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, an event of historical significance, as it marked the end of an era: the generation of peace and love suddenly became the generation of disillusionment.", "popularity": 18.605, "poster_path": "/fFLKCqI7nfkie9V1LmBLljiNV4j.jpg", "release_date": "1970-12-13", "title": "Gimme Shelter", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 156, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "52fe421cc3a36847f8004be1", "order": 13}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18, 28, 53], "id": 5525, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sister's Keeper", "overview": "", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": null, "release_date": "2007-01-01", "title": "Sister's Keeper", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "character": "Olest Brother", "credit_id": "52fe440cc3a36847f807f37f", "order": 6}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/iISJenSldCtDLwhvGpizccWFhDm.jpg", "genre_ids": [99, 10402], "id": 34453, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Grateful Dawg", "overview": "Jerry Garcia, legendary lead guitarist for the Grateful Dead and David Grisman, virtuoso mandolinist and founder of \"Dawg\" music\u2026 Now, for the first time ever, the musical matrimony and extraordinary friendship of Garcia and Grisman is traced in the award-winning documentary Grateful Dawg.", "popularity": 2.391, "poster_path": "/3UnJrBkLVyA1oURdDWGO3JCMWnw.jpg", "release_date": "2000-10-14", "title": "Grateful Dawg", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 6, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "52fe45659251416c91030c05", "order": 0}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/wG9koPQUdvX7EkBukkvMsYbB69N.jpg", "genre_ids": [10402, 99], "id": 41384, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Grateful Dead", "overview": "The Grateful Dead performs live at Winterland in San Francisco in October 1974.", "popularity": 2.033, "poster_path": "/jmHXyX5zDriBrEa8jciyrr6vt5o.jpg", "release_date": "1977-06-02", "title": "The Grateful Dead", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 23, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "52fe45c5c3a36847f80d99cd", "order": 0}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/4ChjYIllKL4Qldr4A7VU3PiBat.jpg", "genre_ids": [10402], "id": 44590, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Grateful Dead: View from the Vault", "overview": "View from the Vault, Volume One, sometimes known simply as View from the Vault, is the first release in a series of DVDs and companion soundtracks by the Grateful Dead known as \"View from the Vault\".
